        <h2>A Developer Who Loves Building Things</h2>
        <p>Hey there! I'm Habip, a 20-year-old junior developer based in Belgium. I discovered my passion for coding a few years ago and haven't looked back since.</p>
        <p>While I enjoy working across the full stack, there's something special about backend development that really excites me. Whether it's designing efficient APIs, optimizing database queries, or architecting scalable systems – I find joy in the logic and structure of server-side programming.</p>
        <p>I'm always eager to learn new technologies and take on challenging projects. Currently, I'm expanding my skills in cloud technologies and modern DevOps practices.</p>
